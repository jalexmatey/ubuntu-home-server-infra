## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

A centralised place for my home servers running Ubuntu's IaC to live.

Why setup an Ubuntu server with IaC?:
* To quickly and safely get a new Ubuntu server device exactly how I want it set up, with minimal clicking of the mouse.
* I don't need to remember every thing I have done.
* It's fun!

## Built With

* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)

## Getting Started

You will need a SSH key on the target server setting up, you can use `ssh-copy-id` to do this. More info can be found [here](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/copy-id).


### Installation

2. Copy `./example.inventory.yml` to `./inventory.yml` and edit.
3. Run `ansible-galaxy install --role-file requirements.yml`.

## Usage
